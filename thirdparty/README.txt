This repo contains the files for Avro and Snappy. Boost is simply too big to checkin.
For Unix builds, download a Boost archive (from http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_59_0.html) and add that archive here.
Once you have the boost archive, you are ready to run the build-thirdparty-libs.sh.
